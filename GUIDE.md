# User Guide

Welcome to Timeline Note-Taker! This guide will help you get the most out of your new note-taking companion.

## ⚡ Quick Note (Global Hotkey)

The fastest way to take a note is using the Quick Note window. You don't need to have the main app open or focused.

1.  Press **`Win + Shift + N`** anywhere in Windows.
2.  Type your note.
3.  Press **`Enter`** to save.
    *   *Tip: Press `Shift + Enter` for a new line.*

### Smart Input Commands

You can assign topics directly while typing using the hashtag syntax:

*   **Basic Topic**: Start with `#topic` followed by your note.
    *   Example: `#work Need to email the team` -> Topic: **work**, Content: "Need to email the team"
*   **Topic with Spaces**: Use quotes for multi-word topics.
    *   Example: `#"Project Alpha" Update the board` -> Topic: **Project Alpha**
*   **Multiple Topics (Tags)**: separate topics with semicolons inside quotes.
    *   Example: `#"Frontend; Bug" Fix the alignment issue` -> Main Topic: **Frontend**, Tag: **Bug**

## 🖼️ Working with Images

You can paste images directly into your notes!

1.  Take a screenshot (e.g., `Win + Shift + S`) or copy an image file.
2.  Open **Quick Note** (`Win + Shift + N`) or the main app input.
3.  Press `Ctrl + V`.
4.  The image will appear as `[Image: path/to/image.png]`.
5.  Save the note, and it will render in the timeline.

## 🔗 Saving Links

When you paste a URL from your clipboard, the app attempts to be smart:

1.  Copy a URL (e.g., from your browser).
2.  Paste it into a note.
3.  If it's just the URL, the app automatically fetches the **Page Title** and format it nicely.

## 📅 Timeline & Filtering

The main window is your hub for reviewing notes.

*   **Date Groups**: Notes are automatically grouped by day (Today, Yesterday, Specific Date).
*   **Filters**:
    *   **Time**: Filter by Today, This Week, or This Month.
    *   **Topic**: Select a topic from the dropdown to see only related notes.
    *   **Type**: Filter by Text, Image, Link, or Code.
*   **Search**: Use the search bar to find keywords in your note content or topics.

## ⚙️ Settings

Click the **Gear Icon ⚙️** in the top right header to access settings.
*   **Attachments Location**: Configure where your pasted images are stored on your disk. Default is your AppData folder.
